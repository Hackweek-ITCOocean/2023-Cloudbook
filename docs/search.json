    "text": "Overview\nThe the era of big data in the earth sciences is here and learning how to effectively use oceanographic remote-sensing data, both in the cloud and on your computer, is a core skill for modern fisheries science and management. Learning how to access cloud-based data, visualize these data, use these data in models, and use the tools of modern reproducible and collaborative science is the main goal of this course. Through the course, participants will gain experience with assessing remote-sensing data in the cloud, R and RStudio, and collaborating with Git and GitHub. Python users: Python is also very heavily used in big data geosciences. The course tutorials will focus on R, however you are welcome to use Python during the course if you are more comfortable with that.\n\nHackweek focus: species distribution modelling\nIn depth understanding of machine learning for species (macrofauna) distribution modelling (SDM) is needed by many young ecosystem researchers. SDMs are an important class of models used to understand species association with the environment. SDMs are widely used to understand how species distributions are changing with ocean climate change and are also used to estimate abundance over large ocean regions from fisheries survey data. This course is devised to familiarize the young professionals in the Indian Ocean-rim (IOR) countries with the latest developments in this field.\nThis course does not aim to teach ecology and habitat to the oceanographers/modellers/machine learning experts, rather it aims to teach machine learning and coding (and its relevance to fisheries) to fishery professionals."

    "text": "Aims and Objectives\n\nLearn how to discover and use oceanographic remote-sensing data for species distribution modeling and other fisheries applications\nFamiliarize participants with using remote-sensing data in R within models. Note participants who are more familiar with Python are welcome to use Python also.\nIntroduce the participants to machine learning models used in species distribution modelling.\nObtain hands-on experience in using species distribution modelling and machine-learning with remote-sensing data.\nWork on a group project using species distribution modelling to estimate habitat associations or obtain a stock estimate using a species distribution model.\n\nNote, there are many ways that participants can study aspects of species distribution using remote-sensing data. During the hackweek portion of the course, participants will jointly develop project to work on and in order to learn by diving into a specific project. Species location will not be specifically required in order to engage in the projects.\n\nWhat is a hackweek?\nHackweeks are widely used in data science to teach new skills in an immersive peer-learning format. From the eScience Institute at the University of Washington, Seattle USA:\nA hackweek is a participant-driven workshop that blends data science education, community building, and project work over a short period of time (one to two weeks). The events are highly immersive and allow participants to work directly with data science professionals to co-shape projects and educational outcomes. Hackweeks often help individuals and teams engage more effectively in open and reproducible science. - eScience Institute, University of Washington\nExamples of recent hackweeks:\n\nNASA Cloud EarthData 2022:\n\nhttps://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/\n\nOceanHackWeek 2022:\n\nhttps://oceanhackweek.org/ohw-resources/\n\nICESat-2 2022 eScience Institute, University of Washington:\n\nhttps://icesat-2-2022.hackweek.io/intro.html\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect\n\nDuring the first week of the ITCOocean course, participants will work on learning how to access, visualize and manipulate remote-sensing data in R. Participants will develop familiarity with the R language, with RStudio, and with Git and GitHub for collaboration.\nThe course is an open science event: all tutorials and examples are developed openly and will be publicly available during and following the course. Participants will strengthen their practice of open science, using open source code and collaborating on their projects with course peers.\n\nIn the two to three weeks leading up to the course, participants are encouraged to review background resources that will facilitate a more effective experience.\n\n\nIndian Ocean and Bay of Bengal Data\nStudents will learn how to access remote-sensing data in the cloud (meaning on-line), but we have also prepared an “analysis ready” data set for students. This will be available on a shared drive and we will introduce the students to the techniques for accessing large datasets without loading them into memory.\n\n\nBounding box\n\nlatitude: -12deg to 32deg\nlongitude: 42deg to 102deg\ngrid: 0.25 deg\ncenters: 0, 0.25, 0.5., 0.75\n\n\n\nDatasets: ERA5\n\nu wind\nv wind\nwind speed\nwind direction\nair temperature @ 2m\nsea surface temperature\n\n\n\nCopernicus\n\nsea level anomaly\nchlorophyll concentration\n\n\n\nSRTM30_PLUS\n\nBathymetry\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html\nhttps://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/usgsCeSrtm30v6.html\n\n\n\n1-km MUR SST\n\nsea surface temperature"

    "text": "Step 5. Tracking changes (Optional)\nNow that you have forked and cloned the repository in your Hub, you can make changes (edit, add, and/or delete content) and track these files using git. In this step, we will provide an overview of how to use git using the graphical interface (the JupyterLab git extension).\n\nStep 5.1. Configure Git (git config)\nConfigure git with your name and email address as shown here.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nOpen a new terminal: File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5.5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\n\nStep 5.2. Create a new file\nLet’s create a new file: In the left panel on your Hub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “2021-Cloud-Hackathon” directory. Then, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File). Add some text to this file, for example: A test file. Save this file and rename it to test.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 5.3. Track the changes to the new file (git add)\nClick the git icon in the left panel. You can see that the newly added file is in the “Untracked” section. You can click the + icon next to the file name to let git track this file for changes.\n\n\n\nStep 5.4. Commit the changes to the new file (git commit)\nNow, you will see that the file is Staged, which means that git is ready to take a snapshot of this file (and the repository) with the changes that you made. This snapshot is called a commit. To commit the changes, add a note (called a commit message) by typing in the text box that say “Summary”.\nNow, click the blue “COMMIT” button to commit this change.\n\nNote: A short message indicating the type of change to this file is a good practice. Optionally, a longer description may be added to the “Description” field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.5. Transmit committed changes to your github (git push)\nAt this stage, you have committed the changes to your git repository on your Hub. However, these changes are still on your Hub and needs to be transmitted to your repository on github (so that both the local copy on the JupyterHub and the remote copy on github are in sync).\nAs seen in the picture below, the git extension indicates (with an orange dot on the cloud icon) that it is ready to push your changes to the remote (remote = your repository on github.com). To push to github, click the cloud button with an up arrow (circled in red in the picture).\n\nWhen you push for the first time, it will ask that you input your credentials. You will need to set this up with your Personal Access Token (PAT), explained next.\n\n\nStep 5.6. Setup your Personal Access Token (PAT)\nWhen you see the following screenshot, GitHub is asking for you to input your credentials. (Note: you see this screenshot when you have committed work to push to GitHub.com, as detailed above).\n\nThe git extension in the Hub is prompting you to enter your github.com credentials. Enter you github.com username and a Personal Access Token (PAT); DO NOT use your password.\nTo create a PAT, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token with the permission as per the image below and specify its validity for 90 days.\n\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nOnce you generate the token, copy it and paste in the Hub window that prompted you to enter the “Personal Access Token”.\n\nGit will show a message at the bottom right telling that the changes were “Successfully pushed”. Also, you will see that the “cloud icon with an up arrow” no longer has an orange dot, indicating that there are no more committed changes to push to the remote (github.com).\n\nNote: You have configured git extension to store your credentials. You will not be prompted for your login/token again!\n\n\nThat’s all. You can use the same workflow (add &gt; commit &gt; push) for any other new or modified files!\n\n\nNote: If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the Terminal (In Hub, New &gt; Terminal) and follow the steps outlined in the Clinic section."

Here our intention is to foster the idea of hacking as a fun, interactive and welcoming environment to explore and experiment with computer code."

You can tag your proposed teammates if you already have that worked out.\nStart a thread with “Project idea:” and then provide a few sentences. Include whether you are looking for teammates to join this project. Others who are interested can respond in a thread.\nWe welcome a broad range of project topics. People often use project time to dig deeper into concepts introduced in tutorials, to explore problems within their own research, or to advance community data sharing and software building efforts.\nThe course team is here to help you get clear on project ideas and decide on what is possible within 5 days.\n\nAt the end of week 1 of the course we will have a “Pitchfest”” where proposer(s) can pitch their idea. At this time we will finalize the project teams for the week — however we will provide times when team members will move and work with other teams. This kind of ‘cross-pollination’ helps everyone learn and solve problems.\nTeam hacktime will begin on week 2.\nEach team is encouraged to identify a project lead, likely the person who pitched the idea, who has knowledge of the datasets and the specific problem to be explored. But roles can be assigned as the group decides to best fit skills and needs.\nOn the final day of the course, each team will present their work in a series of lightning talks."

No other users will be able to see or access your data files. You can easily upload files to your virtual drive space and save files from the hub back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive.\nHere we’ll show you how to pull (copy) some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space using git. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of each tutorial we’ll ask you to “fork” (create your own copy of in your GitHub account) and “clone” (make a copy of in a computing environment, such as your local computer or Openscapes instance) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your Openscapes drive space.\n\n\n\nterminal-button\n\n\nThis will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface:\n\n\n\nterminal-tab\n\n\nNow you can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system.\nYou may also upload files from your local system using the upload button (up-pointing arrow) on the top left of the JupyterHub navigation panel. Similarly, you may download files to your local system by right-clicking the file and selecting download (down-pointing arrow).\nSimple, example GitHub/git/local-workspace workflows for getting a tutorial started in your Openscapes instance and working on a group project are provided. The getting started on a tutorial workflow briefly reviews much of the information in this preliminary exercise along with steps for making and saving notes or other changes as you work through the tutorial and keeping it updated with the original, master copy. The basic git workflow for a project serves as a reminder of the git workflow for working on a group project while minimizing code conflicts that could result from multiple people making changes to the same files simultaneously."

A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions (think of it as a directory with files that are being tracked for changes, using git for taking snapshots of versions as you are developing).\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your 2i2c JupyterHub instance (referred to as 2i2c JupyterHub in these instruction). We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps with substeps, includes instruction for addressing github’s new approach for token authentication.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a github account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Fork a repository\nA fork is a copy of a repository from another github account (for example NASA-Openscapes account) to your github account (for example, my account virdi) that then you have permission to edit. To help you finish this setup correctly, we have created a demo repository on Openscapes github account named check_github_setup. You can fork this repository into your github account following these steps:\n\nLog in to your github.com account\nGo to the demo repository at NASA-Openscapes github\n\nClick on the fork icon in the top right corner, as shown in the image below and click your user name if prompted to do so\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Clone the repository that you just forked\nNow you have a fork of the demo repository in your github account that we can clone it in your 2i2c instance. In the code below, commands beginning with git is a git command for version control and synching; commands that don’t start with git are bash/linux/command line commands.\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub and open a terminal\nFile &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\nMake sure you are in your home directory by usingpwd command and verifying the output as below\n/home/jovyan\n\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nNote: This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember git is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by git, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you push your repository to github.com (git push is discussed in a later step).\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

No other users will be able to see or access your data files. You can easily upload files to your virtual drive space and save files from the hub back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive.\nHere we’ll show you how to pull (copy) some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space using git. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of each tutorial we’ll ask you to “fork” (create your own copy of in your GitHub account) and “clone” (make a copy of in a computing environment, such as your local computer or Openscapes instance) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your Openscapes drive space.\n\n\n\nterminal-button\n\n\nThis will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface:\n\n\n\nterminal-tab\n\n\nNow you can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system.\nYou may also upload files from your local system using the upload button (up-pointing arrow) on the top left of the JupyterHub navigation panel. Similarly, you may download files to your local system by right-clicking the file and selecting download (down-pointing arrow).\nSimple, example GitHub/git/local-workspace workflows for getting a tutorial started in your Openscapes instance and working on a group project are provided. The getting started on a tutorial workflow briefly reviews much of the information in this preliminary exercise along with steps for making and saving notes or other changes as you work through the tutorial and keeping it updated with the original, master copy. The basic git workflow for a project serves as a reminder of the git workflow for working on a group project while minimizing code conflicts that could result from multiple people making changes to the same files simultaneously."

    "section": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)",
    "text": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)\n\nWhat is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?\nVersion control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). git is a popular tool used for version control of software code. github.com is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions (think of it as a directory with files that are being tracked for changes, using git for taking snapshots of versions as you are developing).\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your 2i2c JupyterHub instance (referred to as 2i2c JupyterHub in these instruction). We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps with substeps, includes instruction for addressing github’s new approach for token authentication.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a github account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Fork a repository\nA fork is a copy of a repository from another github account (for example NASA-Openscapes account) to your github account (for example, my account virdi) that then you have permission to edit. To help you finish this setup correctly, we have created a demo repository on Openscapes github account named check_github_setup. You can fork this repository into your github account following these steps:\n\nLog in to your github.com account\nGo to the demo repository at NASA-Openscapes github\n\nClick on the fork icon in the top right corner, as shown in the image below and click your user name if prompted to do so\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Clone the repository that you just forked\nNow you have a fork of the demo repository in your github account that we can clone it in your 2i2c instance. In the code below, commands beginning with git is a git command for version control and synching; commands that don’t start with git are bash/linux/command line commands.\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub and open a terminal\nFile &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\nMake sure you are in your home directory by usingpwd command and verifying the output as below\n/home/jovyan\n\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nNote: This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember git is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by git, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you push your repository to github.com (git push is discussed in a later step).\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

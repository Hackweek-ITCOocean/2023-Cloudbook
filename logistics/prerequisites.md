title: Prerequisites & setup
---

Before the Hackathon, please do the following (20 minutes). All software is free.
If you are attending the Clinic, please do this in advance of the Clinic. 

1. **Create a GitHub account**
    - GitHub: <https://github.com>
    - Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    - Send us your username at least 24 hours before the event (TODO revisit process)
    - Remember your username, email and password; you will need to be logged in them during the workshop!
1. **Others? TODO revisit**
1. **Get comfortable.** Consider your computer set-up in advance, including an external monitor if possible. You will be following along in Jupyter Hub on your own computer while also watching an instructor live-code over Zoom (or equivalent), and will also want quick-access to Slack to ask for help and follow links.

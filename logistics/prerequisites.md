## Daily setup

1. Log into 2i2c: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/hub/>


## Getting help

We will use Slack rather than Zoom Chat as our main channel for help, since the conversations are preserved beyond a single call and since it's easier to reply and have threaded conversations and post screenshots.

### Slack

You will be invited to the Openscapes Slack organization, where there is a growing community of [Openscapes Champions](https://openscapes.org/champions). We have three private Slack channels for the Hackathon: 

**2021-nasacloudhack-general**: General channel is for announcements and general questions and communications.
 
**2021-nasacloudhack-projects**: Projects channel  is for for participants to pitch project ideas and discuss projects with the whole hackathon group. As teams form you can have direct messages with your team (and we can create new channels as needed). 

**2021-nasacloudhack-help**: Help channel is the place to get troubleshooting help: please paste error messages and post screenshots and we will help you by replying to your post.

To create a screenshot:

### Breakout Rooms

If you'd like to talk to someone and live-screenshare about your issue, please write in Zoom Chat that you need help and we will move you into a breakout room with a helper.

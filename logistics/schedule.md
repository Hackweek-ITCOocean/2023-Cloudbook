**The 2021 Cloud Hackathon will take place November 15-19 from 9am-1pm PST [(UTC-8)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pst) each day**.   

An optional pre-hackathon clinic will be held on November 9 from 8-10am PST, and the recording will be made available to all hackathon participants to review on their own.

All Cloud Hackathon activities are **virtual**. We will engage primarily with this group and schedule via Zoom and Slack (TODO check & setup).

**Zoom links** will be posted on the `#TODO XX` Slack channel! Stay tuned!

        "In the previous exercises we searched for and discovered cloud data assets that met certain search criteria (i.e., intersects with our region of interest and for a specified date range). The end goal was to find and save web links to the data assets we want to use in our workflow. The links we found allow us to download data via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). However, NASA allows for direct in-region S3 bucket access for the same assets. In addition to saving the HTTPS links, we also created and saved the S3 links for those same cloud assets and we will use them here. In this exercise we will demonstrate how to perform direction in-region S3 bucket access for Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) cloud data assets.  \n",

        "- S3 on its own does not solve ‘cloud’ problems, but it is one key technology in solving big data problems  \n",

        "The above exercise demonstrated how to perform in-region direct S3 bucket access for HLS cloud data assets. HLS cloud data assets are stored as [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/), a format that has been the benifactor of data discovery and access advancements within the Python ecosystem. Knowing what the data storage format is (e.g., COG, netcdf4, or zarr store) and/or what data access protocol you're using is critical in determining what Python data access method you will use. For COG data, `rioxarray` package is often prefered due to is ability to bring the geospatial data format into an `xarray` object. For netcdf4 files, the standard `xarray` package incombination with `s3fs` allow users to perform in-region direct access reads into an xarray object. Finally, if you are using OPeNDAP to connect to data, specialized packages like `pydap` have been integrated into `xarray` for streamline access directly to an `xarray` object. "

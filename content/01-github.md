### GitHub

GitHub allows you to store files in "repositories", which is like a folder. This is a popular way that code is shared and there are many community resources shared on GitHub that you will want to be able to use in your JupyterHub. You can also link your own GitHub repositories to your JupyterHub. 

Being familiar with version control (making commits as you work), Git and GitHub is important skill for reproducible science because this is a part of the current workflow for sharing work with the wider community of scientists.

We will cover using Git and GitHub in separate lectures

* [Git in RStudio](git-rstudio.md)
* [Git in Jupyter Lab](git-jupyter.md) (optional not covered in this hackweek)


## What is GitHub?
[GitHub](https://github.com) is a hosting service for `Git` repositories,
enabling us to share code across teams in a web environment.

## Why do I need a GitHub account?

1. Your GitHub accounts will give you access to the hackweek cloud computing resources
2. All hackweek tutorials will be shared on GitHub
3. All project teams will use GitHub to collaborate and work together on their code
4. GitHub is widely used to share code across the geosciences. If you don't know how to use GitHub, you are missing out on a wealth of community shared knowledge.

## Creating a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Next, enter your email address and click on the green 'Sign up for GitHub' button.
You will need to answer a few required questions in the following dialogs.

## Repositories

Each repository is a container for a specific subset of material.

## Cloud/JupyterHub overview

A brief overview about the [NASA Openscapes Cloud Environment](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/clinic/jupyterhub.html) (following lessons from the Clinic).

## GitHub setup for tutorials

See [GitHub First-Time Setup](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/logistics/github-workflows.html#first-time-setup) page

## Practice creating a jupyter notebook?

## Open a tutorial template notebook

Navigate to `tutorials-template` folder. Our first tutorial is `Data_discovery_with_cmr.ipynb`


## How to I end my session?
*(Also see [How do I end my Openscapes session? Will I lose all of my work?](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/clinic/jupyterhub.html#how-do-i-end-my-openscapes-session-will-i-lose-all-of-my-work)

When you are finished working for the day it is important to explicitly log out of your Openscapes session. The reason for this is it will save us a bit of money! When you keep a session active it uses up AWS resources and keeps a series of virtual machines deployed.

Stopping the server happens automatically when you log out, so navigate to “File -> Log Out” and just click “Log Out”!

!!! NOTE “logging out” - Logging out will **NOT** cause any of your work to be lost or deleted. It simply shuts down some resources. It would be equivalent to turning off your desktop computer at the end of the day.

    "\n",
    "This tutorial will combine several workflow steps and components from the previous days, demonstrating the process of using the geolocation of data available outside of the Earthdata Cloud to then access coincident variables of cloud-accessible data. This may be a common use case as NASA Earthdata continues to migrate to the cloud, producing a \"hybrid\" data archive across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and original on-premise data storage systems. Additionally, you may also want to combine field measurements with remote sensing data available on the Earthdata Cloud.\n",

    "This specific example explores the harmonization of the ICESat-2 ATL03 data product, currently (as of November 2021) available publicaly via direct download at the NSIDC DAAC, with Sea Surface Temperature variables available from PO.DAAC on the Earthdata Cloud. \n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine storage location of datasets of interest\n",
    "2. Determine size of ATL03 data over area of interest (determine large size; need to subset by geographic region)\n",
    "3. Determine subsetting capabilities of ATL03\n",
    "4. Subset and download ATL03 - describe that this is being \"downloaded\" to our cloud environment - what does that mean in terms of cost, etc.\n",
    "5. Determine size of SST data\n",
    "6. Determine variables of interest: SST, ocean color, chemistry... \n",
    "7. Pull those variables into xarray \"in place\" \n",
    "8. Use geolocation of ICESat-2 to define the single transect used to pull coincident ocean data out from array\n",
    "9. Create a plot of the single transect of gridded data (bonus: time series) - describe what this means to egress out of the cloud versus pulling the original data down (benefit to processing in the cloud)\n"

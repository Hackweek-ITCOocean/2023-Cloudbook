title: GitHub/Jupyter workflows
---

We will be live-coding during the tutorials and collaborating during the project hack-time, using GitHub in both cases. Here is how to setup and work for each. 

Note: we'll be using Git together with GitHub and will talk about them interchangeably. 

## First-Time Setup

**We will do these steps together during the first week of the course**

### Fork the Cloudbook repo

Go to [https://github.com/Hackweek-ITCOocean/2023-Cloudbook](https://github.com/Hackweek-ITCOocean/2023-Cloudbook) and fork the repository. This will enable you to follow along with the tutorials.

> Note: The term fork means that you are going to copy the project into your own user space in Github


## Daily Setup

### GitHub: Pull updates from the Cloudbook repo

## Adapting the tutorials

You will need to work in a different directory than the Cloudbook repo. So if you are using a tutorial as a template, make sure to save a copy and work in the copy in a **different folder**.

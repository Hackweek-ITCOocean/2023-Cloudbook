title: Set-up Overview
---

For the course, we be mainly using a browser based platform (JupyterHub) for coding and projects. JupyterHub and JupyterLab is a standard platform for "big data geoscience" and working on this platform will prepare you for using the tools and notebooks developed by this research community. The JupyterHub will allow you to work on projects without having to install anything on personal computers. We will also cover installation on your personal computer.

## Prerequisites

For the course, we require that you complete a short (and free) intro course to R and RStudio so you have a basic understanding of R and have R and RStudio installed.

### R courses

## Pre-course clinic: learn basics of R

It is important that you come into the course with a basic understanding of R and RStudio. Before 

* If you have never used R or RStudio and have not done much programming, start with this 4 hour course: Basics of R and installing RStudio https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/

* If you know the basics of R but have never done modeling, then you can start with this 2.5 hour course that covers basic linear regression with R and plotting with ggplot2: https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1

* https://www.ucl.ac.uk/short-courses/search-courses/statistical-computing-r-programming-language-gentle-introduction

* For a longer free course, you can do this one. Note this is 20 hours. You do NOT need to do this whole course before the hackweek! https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r

* One of the best free R courses is https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming. You can see the lectures for free. Make sure to click AUDIT when it asks you to sign up for a 7-day trial. You do not need to sign up for anything to go through the material.




### Install R and RStudio Desktop

* R: https://cran.r-project.org/
    - Install the latest version of R that you can for your operating system. Preferably you want version 4.3+ but at the least you need version 4.1.
    - If you have R already installed, update to the newest version (4.3)
* RStudio Desktop: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
    - Install the most recent version you can. Update your version if you have an old version installed.

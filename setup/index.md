## Install R and RStudio Desktop

For the course, we will mainly be using a browser based platform (JupyterHub) for coding and projects. JupyterHub and JupyterLab is a standard platform for "big data geoscience" and working on this platform will prepare you for using the tools and notebooks developed by this research community. However we also want you to be able to run R and RStudio on your own computer.

* R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - Install the latest version of R that you can for your operating system. Preferably you want version 4.3+ but at the least you need version 4.1.
    - If you have R already installed, update to the newest version (4.3)
* RStudio Desktop: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
    - Install the most recent version you can. Update your version if you have an old version installed.

## Do an intro to R course

For the course and hackweek, we require that you complete a short introduction course to R and RStudio--unless you already have R experience. This way you will be ready to start working with the course scripts and tutorials on day 1. These will only take you a 2-3 hours and will make your course experience much more worthwhile.

Any of these is sufficient. Note, if you already program in R, you do not need to do this.

* [W3Schools Basic R](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp)

* [Basics of R and installing RStudio](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)

* [YouTube: R for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDRa82lxzaU)

* For a longer free course, CodeAcademy has a good [Intro to R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r). Note this is 20 hours. You do NOT need to do this whole course before the hackweek! 

* If you know the basics of R but have never done modeling, then you can start with this [2.5 hour course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1) that covers basic linear regression with R and plotting with ggplot2: 

* One of the best free R courses is [Coursera's Learn R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming). You can see the lectures for free. Make sure to click AUDIT when it asks you to sign up for a 7-day trial. You do not need to sign up for anything to go through the material.

### Slack

We will use Slack as a platform for discussions and questions, since the conversations are preserved and everyone can see the answers and discussions.

You will be invited to the Hackweek-ITCOocean Slack organization. New to Slack? See this [Quick Start Guide](https://zenodo.org/record/3763730#.YYkoL3mIZpQ). We have three private Slack channels for the course: 

**2023-general**: General channel is for announcements and general questions and communications.
 
**2023-projects**: Projects channel  is for for participants to pitch project ideas and discuss projects with the whole course group. As teams form you can have direct messages with your team (and we can create new channels as needed). 

**2023-help**: Help channel is the place to get troubleshooting help: please paste error messages and post screenshots and we will help you by replying to your post.

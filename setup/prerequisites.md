## Prerequisites

Before the course, please do the following (20 minutes). All software is free.

1. **GitHub username**
    - Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t already have one) at <https://github.com>. Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    - Please [provide your GitHub username here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOd0RhzEo5sFq_NgjZJa0C6cmaicTOjPS290iCbHbFTI-8zg/viewform?usp=sf_link); this will allow us to add you to the cloud hackathon workspace.
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Earthdata Login account** 
    - Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov>
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Slack**
    - Join our Slack workspace (invite sent via email). In the `2023-projects` channel, suggest a project idea/use case, and mention if you are looking for teammates to join. Read through other entries and comment on those of interest to you. On the last day of week 1, we will hold a project pitchfest where you will present ideas to the group. 

## Getting help

We will use Slack as a platform for discussions and questions, since the conversations are preserved beyond a single call and since it's easier to reply and have threaded conversations and post screenshots.

### Slack

You will be invited to the Hackweek-ITCOocean Slack organization. New to Slack? See this [Quick Start Guide](https://zenodo.org/record/3763730#.YYkoL3mIZpQ). We have three private Slack channels for the course: 

**2023-general**: General channel is for announcements and general questions and communications.
 
**2023-projects**: Projects channel  is for for participants to pitch project ideas and discuss projects with the whole course group. As teams form you can have direct messages with your team (and we can create new channels as needed). 

**2023-help**: Help channel is the place to get troubleshooting help: please paste error messages and post screenshots and we will help you by replying to your post.

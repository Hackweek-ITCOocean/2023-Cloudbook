    - Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov>

1. **Slack**
    - Join our Slack workspace (invite sent via email). In the `2023-general` channel, introduce yourself to the group. 

### Slack

We will use Slack as a platform for discussions and questions, since the conversations are preserved and everyone can see the answers and discussions.

You will be invited to the Hackweek-ITCOocean Slack organization. New to Slack? See this [Quick Start Guide](https://zenodo.org/record/3763730#.YYkoL3mIZpQ). We have three private Slack channels for the course: 

**2023-general**: General channel is for announcements and general questions and communications.
 
**2023-projects**: Projects channel  is for for participants to pitch project ideas and discuss projects with the whole course group. As teams form you can have direct messages with your team (and we can create new channels as needed). 

**2023-help**: Help channel is the place to get troubleshooting help: please paste error messages and post screenshots and we will help you by replying to your post.

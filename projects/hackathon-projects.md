title: Hackathon Projects
---

9 awesome teams presented work-in-progress projects they had been hacking on during the Hackathon, we were so excited to see what they had already done and their ongoing momentum. Hackathon participants will have 3 months of continued access to the 2i2c JupyterHub and our Hackathon Slack Channel as they continue experimenting. This way we can all learn more about what the transition to the Cloud looks like (and costs) and support more researchers using NASA Earthdata on the Cloud. 

Below is brief information about each project team, with links to slides and notebooks in GitHub repos that they shared on the final day of the Hackathon.

## 1: Field Campaigns

**Team:** Tom Farrar, Kyla Drushka, Bia Villas Boas., Matthew Archer, Kathleen Dohan, Severine Fournier, Eli Hunter, John Wilkin

**Primary Helpers:** Jinbo Wang, Jack McNelis, Ed Armstrong

**GitHub:** <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/nch2021-projects-contexdata>

**Project Goals:** 
Extract and visualize multiple data sets that can be used to give context to field campaigns or other regional events (e.g., the "Warm Blob" or the recent atmospheric river event on the West Coast).  For example, choose a target region and time period, cycle through all available high-resolution sea surface temperature data, identify clear images, catalog them.  Extract wind, wave, sea surface height, salinity data. 

- Identify a region and time period
- Ingest/subset several datasets
- Create specific functions to operate on the datasets, specifically regrid to a common space/time

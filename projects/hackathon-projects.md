title: Hackathon Projects
---

9 awesome teams presented work-in-progress projects they had been hacking on during the Hackathon, we were so excited to see what they had already done and their ongoing momentum. Hackathon participants will have 3 months of continued access to the 2i2c JupyterHub and our Hackathon Slack Channel as they continue experimenting. This way we can all learn more about what the transition to the Cloud looks like (and costs) and support more researchers using NASA Earthdata on the Cloud. 

Below is brief information about each project team, with links to slides and notebooks in GitHub repos that they shared on the final day of the Hackathon.

## 1: Field Campaigns

**Team:** Tom Farrar, Kyla Drushka, Bia Villas Boas., Matthew Archer, Kathleen Dohan, Severine Fournier, Eli Hunter, John Wilkin

**Primary Helpers:** Jinbo Wang, Jack McNelis, Ed Armstrong

[**Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l2RxFG1tO-0piDvKUkdUQC0wHwp7lFhPSSbLCpESSW4/edit#slide=id.p)

**GitHub:** <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/nch2021-projects-contexdata>

**Project Goals:** 
Extract and visualize multiple data sets that can be used to give context to field campaigns or other regional events (e.g., the "Warm Blob" or the recent atmospheric river event on the West Coast).  For example, choose a target region and time period, cycle through all available high-resolution sea surface temperature data, identify clear images, catalog them.  Extract wind, wave, sea surface height, salinity data. 

## 2: Global Upwelling Patterns

**Team:** Eli Holmes, Jorge Vazquez

**Primary Helpers:** Aaron Friesz, Andy Barrett, Jack McNelis

[**Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YjBrNRHCPWUKjoT5FC3FgqhzcVuJsqtmrFdRW29FkGs/edit#slide=id.p), **GitHub:** <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/nhw21-projects-upwelling>

**Project Goals:** 
Climate change is predicted to change coastal upwelling. This study explores the use of simple SST metrics for studying upwelling signatures.


## 3/8: Surface Body Water

**Team:** Matthew Bonnema, Maximilian Parzen

[**Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o_o8FLjzX86XWc-idKujpxDwHVtoF5sHfFxCCw3bgwA/edit#slide=id.p), **GitHub:** <https://github.com/pz-max/NASA_projectX>

**Project Goals:** 
Estimate surface area of surface water body and track changes over time. Test Case: Oroville Reservoir, California


## 4: Pypsicle: cryo computing in the cloud

**Team:** Chad Greene, Susan Howard, Luis Lopez, Cassandra Nickles, Christine Sadlik, Jessica Scheick

**Primary Helpers:** Luis Lopez

[**Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1umWIIJ49U1Lukk78EJI6q-tii3s91qJpSmHWPEkqCxg/edit?usp=sharing), **GitHub:** <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/nch2021-projects-pypsicle>, **Notebook: **  <https://nbviewer.org/github/NASA-Openscapes/nch2021-projects-pypsicle/blob/main/S3-h5_example_rendered.ipynb>

**Project Goals:** 
Selectively read in part of an hdf5 file, explore a dataset on the cloud

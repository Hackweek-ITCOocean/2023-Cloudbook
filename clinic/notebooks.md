## Intro Python 

How to import libraries, talk through some code structure

## Run notebook

see how it works, but that you might want to make a change

## Commit changes

Make some edits -- TODO

Commit

## Push changes

TODO

## Commit and push again

some more python concepts?

TODO

## Update your fork 

*(During the break, Luis/someone added something to the notebook)*

And how to update your fork from main. 2 step process:

- From github.com, click these buttons
- From 2i2c, `git fetch` (I think?)

Discuss merge conflicts and philosophy: best way to deal with merge conflicts is to avoid them; talk to your colleagues, commit often. Also can work with branches (out of the scope of this Clinic?)

## Closing

Thanks for coming!

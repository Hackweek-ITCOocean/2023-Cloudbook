title: Pre-Hackathon Clinic
---

Before the Hackathon, we are hosting a 2-hour Clinic where you can build skills and practice the tooling and workflow that we will use during the Hackathon. 

The Clinic will cover the following as a workflow: 

- Jupyter Hub with 2i2c
- Jupyter Notebooks with Python
- GitHub from the web and shell: forking, cloning, pulling, committing, pushing

## Before the Clinic

Code of Conduct reminder

Summary of what we'll do

## Log into 2i2c

Go to <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/hub/>. You will be asked to log in with your GitHub Account. 

This will take several minutes. While we wait, we'll get set up with GitHub and a brief overview. 

## GitHub overview

TODO Julie - images and narration: 

- main unit: a repo
- remote and local
- commits, push, pull
- fork

### Fork and Clone

Go to <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Clinic>

Click Fork. This will make a copy of this repo in your GitHub account.

## Jupyter Hub Overview

Now an intro to 2i2c, a which is a Jupyter Hub. 

TODO: insert images

Orient to 2i2c 

### Open the terminal

The command line, also called the Shell or Terminal, is available in 2i2c. 

Open a terminal in 2i2c: File > New... > Terminal. Note that you can toggle between "Simple" display mode in the bottom left. 

## Clone repo to 2i2c

We will clone our repo into 2i2c so that we can run it in the Cloud. We do this from the Terminal.

Make sure you clone from your forked repo. For example, my url has my username "betolink", not "NASA-Openscapes".

`git clone https://github.com/betolink/2021-Cloud-Clinic`

## Python environments

TODO overview discussion

Walk through `environment.yml` file from <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Clinic>

## Jupyter notebook

Talk through the example from <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Clinic>

Import the library you defined in the environment. (If you don’t have the library defined in the environment and try to import it, it will give you an error (unless it’s part of core Python))

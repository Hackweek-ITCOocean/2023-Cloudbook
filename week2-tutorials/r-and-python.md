## Introduction :: Programming in R

It is important that you come into the course with a basic understanding of R. There are many free courses. 

* If you have never used R or RStudio and have not done much programming, start with this 4 hour course: Basics of R and installing RStudio [https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)

* If you know the basics of R but have never done modeling, then you can start with this 2.5 hour course that covers basic linear regression with R and plotting with ggplot2: [https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1](https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1)

* For a longer free course, you can do this one. Note this is 20 hours. You do NOT need to do this whole course before the hackweek! [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r)

* One of the best free R courses is [https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming). You can see the lectures for free. Make sure to click AUDIT when it asks you to sign up for a 7-day trial. You do not need to sign up for anything to go through the material.
